# Architectural Matters

## Combined System Components

## Optimized Hardware and Software Interaction

## Migrating the Workload from General-Purpose to Fixed-Purpose Hardware

## Power Sharing Between the CPU and the GPU

## Using Low-Power Core, Uncore, and Graphics

#### Power reduction of RAM/ROM periphery and core array

#### Reduce VDD during sleep mode to manage leakage

#### Independent memory bank collapse for large high-density memories

#### Advanced low-power clocking and clock tree optimization

#### Clock domain partitioning

#### Independent frequency clock domains

#### Fine-grained tuning of clock gating

## Using Power Domains or Power Islands

#### Independent voltage scaling for active and sleep modes

#### Power gating across power domains

## Offering Power-Aware Simulation and Verification

#### Tradeoffs among power, area, and timing

#### Comparative analysis of low-power solutions
